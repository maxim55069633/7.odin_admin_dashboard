This project aims to practice my grid skills intensively based on the given 2-dimension layout (Odin project sample).

I also learn the following things:

1. Leverage online resource to improve development efficiency. E.g: Check color palettes from Tailwind. Download icons and svg images from Material Design Icons.
2. Create a circle, put the user's avatar into it and resize.

This is the grid sample from the odin project:
