This project aims to practice my grid skills intensively based on the given 2-dimension layout (Odin project sample). I also learn the following things:
1. How to leverage online resource to improve development efficiency? E.g: Check color palettes from Tailwind. Download icons and svg images from Material Design Icons.
2. How to create a circle, put the user's avatar into it and resize?
3. How to capture the entire webpage using Firefox's console toolbox?

This is the grid sample from the odin project:
